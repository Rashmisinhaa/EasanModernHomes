						<div class="mb-3">
							<h5 class="mb-2 text-blue1">1. What is a cookie?</h5>
							<p class="fw-4 fs-6"> A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to store on your computer or mobile device. The cookie allows the website to “remember” your actions or preferences over time. Most Internet browsers support cookies; however, users can set their browsers to decline certain types of cookies or specific cookies. Further, users can delete cookies at any time.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="mb-3">
							<h5 class="mb-2 text-blue1">2. Why do we use cookies?</h5>
							<p class="fw-4 fs-6"> We use cookies to learn how you interact with our content and to improve your experience when visiting our website(s). For example, some cookies remember your language or preferences so that you do not have to repeatedly make these choices when you visit one of our websites. We also use cookies to help us with geolocation tracking in order to present you with the closest office locations or delivery priorities. We may employ the learnings of your behavior on our website(s) to serve you with targeted advertisements on third-party website(s) in an effort to “re-market” our products and services to you.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="mb-3">
							<h5 class="mb-2 text-blue1">4. First Party Cookies</h5>
							<p class="fw-4 fs-6"> First-party cookies are cookies issued from the domain relating to this website that are generally used to identify language and location preferences or render basic site functionality.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="mb-3">
							<h5 class="mb-2 text-blue1">5. Session Cookies</h5>
							<p class="fw-4 fs-6"> Session cookies are temporary cookies that are used to remember you during the course of your visit to the website, and they expire when you close the web browser.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="mb-3">
							<h5 class="mb-2 text-blue1">6. Persistent Cookies</h5>

							<h5 class="mb-2 text-blue1">7. How are cookies used for advertising purposes?</h5>
							<p class="fw-4 fs-6"> Cookies and ad technology such as web beacons, pixels, and anonymous ad network tags help us serve relevant ads to you more effectively. They also help us collect aggregated audit data, research, and performance reporting for advertisers. Pixels enable us to understand and improve the delivery of ads to you and know when certain ads have been shown to you. Since your web browser may request advertisements and web beacons directly from ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Although we do not use cookies to create a profile of your browsing behavior on third-party sites, we do use aggregate data from third parties to show you relevant, interest-based advertising. We do not provide any personal information that we collect to advertisers. You can opt out of off-site and third-party informed advertising by adjusting your cookie settings. Opting out will not remove advertising from the pages you visit, but, instead, opting out will result in the ads you see not being matched to your interests. This implies that the ad(s) you see will not be matched to your interests by those specific cookies.</p>
						</div>

							<h5 class="mb-2 text-blue1">8. How are third-party cookies used?</h5>
							<p class="fw-4 fs-6"> For some of the functions within our websites we use third-party suppliers, for example, when you visit a page with videos embedded from or links to YouTube.
